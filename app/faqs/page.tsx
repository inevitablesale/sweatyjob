      question: "How does the AI mower work without boundary wires?",
      answer:
        "Our AI mowers use advanced GPS technology instead of traditional boundary wires. We install a GPS pole, connect the mower to your WiFi, and plug it in. The intelligent mapping feature creates virtual boundaries, eliminating the need for unsightly wires around your property. The mower uses cameras with object recognition powered by artificial intelligence to navigate and avoid obstacles.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the monthly cost and is there a contract?",
      answer:
        "The subscription is $30/week ($120/month) with no long-term commitment. You can cancel anytime with no penalties. There may be a one-time setup fee depending on your lawn size and complexity. We believe in transparency - no hidden fees, no surprises.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the AI mower installed on my property?",
      answer:

The entire setup process takes about an hour. Our team will walk you through the process and ensure everything is working perfectly before we leave.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the AI mower safe for children and pets?",
      answer:
        "Yes, our AI mowers have multiple safety features including lift sensors, obstacle detection, and blade-stop technology that activates when the mower is lifted or tilted. The cameras with object recognition can detect and avoid pets, children, and other obstacles. The mowers operate at a low noise level and are designed with safety as a top priority.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during bad weather?",
      answer:
        "Our AI mowers have rain sensors and will return to their charging station during heavy rain. They can operate in light rain and will resume mowing when conditions improve. The mowers are weather-resistant and designed to handle various outdoor conditions. The system also monitors weather forecasts and adjusts mowing schedules accordingly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How large of an area can the AI mower handle?",

For larger properties, we may recommend multiple mowers or a custom solution. The mowers are designed to handle slopes up to 20 degrees and can navigate complex lawn layouts.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be home when the AI mower is operating?",
      answer:
        "No, the AI mower works autonomously according to its programmed schedule.

    },
    {
      question: "What happens if the AI mower breaks down?",

      question: "Do you offer any guarantees?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not completely satisfied with our work, we'll make it right or you can cancel your subscription with no penalties. We stand behind the quality of our service and the reliability of our AI mowers.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "How often does the AI mower cut my lawn?",
      answer:
        "Unlike traditional lawn services that cut your grass once a week, our AI mowers operate daily (or according to an optimized schedule) to maintain your lawn at the perfect height. This frequent cutting promotes healthier grass growth and results in a consistently manicured appearance. The mowers cut just a small amount each time, and the clippings are fine enough to decompose quickly and act as natural fertilizer.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Founders Club and why is it limited to 100 members?",
      answer:
        "The Founders Club is our exclusive membership program limited to 100 members in Richmond. We've intentionally limited membership to ensure we can provide exceptional service to each member. Founders Club members receive priority service, early access to new features and services, and special community events. Once all 100 spots are filled, we'll start a waitlist for future openings.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the AI mower benefit the environment?",
      answer:
        "Our AI mowers are 100% electric and produce zero emissions, unlike gas-powered lawn equipment. They operate quietly, reducing noise pollution in your neighborhood. The frequent cutting approach promotes healthier grass that requires less water and fertilizer, and the fine clippings naturally fertilize your lawn. By choosing our service, you're making an environmentally responsible choice.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the mowing schedule?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can customize the mowing schedule through the mobile app. While we recommend daily mowing for optimal results, you can adjust the frequency and timing to suit your preferences. You can also set quiet hours or designate specific days when you'd prefer the mower not to operate, such as when you're hosting outdoor events.",
