            Bellevue's historic homes are known for their beautiful lawns that complement the neighborhood's charming
            character. The unique soil conditions and Richmond's climate present both opportunities and challenges for
            lawn care in this area. Here's how to keep your Bellevue lawn looking its best year-round.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Bellevue's Soil Profile</h2>
          <p>
            Bellevue's soil tends to be a mix of clay and loam, which affects how you should approach lawn care.
            Clay-heavy soil retains water longer but can become compacted, while the loam components provide good
            drainage and nutrient retention. This combination means:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Water deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth</li>
            <li>Aerate your lawn annually to combat soil compaction common in Bellevue yards</li>
            <li>Add organic matter to improve soil structure, especially in newer developments</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many Bellevue homes, particularly those along Bellevue Avenue and near MacArthur Avenue, have mature trees
            that create shaded lawn areas. These sections require special attention as they receive less sunlight and
            often compete with tree roots for nutrients.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8 mb-4">Seasonal Lawn Care Calendar for Bellevue</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Spring (March-May)</h3>
          <p>As Richmond emerges from winter, Bellevue lawns need preparation for the growing season:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Apply pre-emergent herbicide in early spring (typically March) to prevent crabgrass</li>
            <li>Test soil pH and add lime if needed (Bellevue soils often tend toward acidity)</li>
            <li>Begin mowing when grass reaches 3 inches, keeping height at 2.5-3 inches for most Bellevue lawns</li>
            <li>Overseed bare patches with grass varieties that match your existing lawn</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Summer (June-August)</h3>
          <p>Richmond's hot, humid summers can stress Bellevue lawns:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Water deeply (1-1.5 inches) once or twice weekly, preferably in early morning</li>
            <li>Raise mowing height to 3-3.5 inches to protect roots from heat</li>
            <li>Spot-treat for summer weeds like dandelions and clover</li>
            <li>Apply slow-release fertilizer in early summer if grass shows signs of nutrient deficiency</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Fall (September-November)</h3>
          <p>Fall is the prime season for lawn care in Bellevue:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Aerate in September to relieve soil compaction</li>
            <li>Overseed with cool-season grasses like tall fescue, which perform well in Bellevue</li>
            <li>Apply fall fertilizer in October to strengthen root systems</li>
            <li>Continue mowing until growth stops, gradually lowering height to 2-2.5 inches</li>
            <li>
              Remove fallen leaves promptly to prevent lawn damage (especially important for homes near Bellevue's
              mature tree canopy)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Winter (December-February)</h3>
          <p>Even during dormancy, Bellevue lawns need some attention:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Minimize foot traffic on frozen grass</li>
            <li>Apply winter weed control as needed</li>
            <li>Plan lawn care strategy for the coming year</li>
            <li>Service lawn equipment before spring</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8 mb-4">Bellevue-Specific Lawn Challenges</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Shade Management</h3>
          <p>
            Many Bellevue properties feature mature oak, maple, and elm trees that create significant shade. For these
            areas:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Choose shade-tolerant grass varieties like fine fescue or St. Augustine</li>
            <li>Prune lower tree branches to allow more sunlight to reach the lawn</li>
            <li>Mow shaded areas slightly higher than sunny sections</li>
            <li>Consider shade-friendly ground covers for deeply shaded areas where grass struggles</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-green-700 mt-6 mb-3">Historic Property Considerations</h3>
          <p>For Bellevue's many historic homes:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Research historic landscaping patterns to maintain period-appropriate lawn aesthetics</li>
            <li>
              Be mindful of underground utilities and historic infrastructure when aerating or installing irrigation
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider incorporating traditional elements like formal edges or ornamental grasses that complement
              historic architecture
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mt-8 mb-4">Water Conservation for Bellevue Lawns</h2>
          <p>With increasing focus on sustainability, Bellevue homeowners can practice water-efficient lawn care:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>
              Install rain barrels to collect water from downspouts (particularly effective for Bellevue's older homes
              with established gutter systems)
            </li>
            <li>Consider smart irrigation controllers that adjust watering based on weather conditions</li>
            <li>Apply mulch around trees and in garden beds to reduce evaporation and runoff</li>
            <li>Incorporate drought-resistant grass varieties in new lawn installations or when overseeding</li>
          </ul>
