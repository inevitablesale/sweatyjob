          <p>
            Richmond's relationship with lawns has deep historical roots. From the grand estates of Windsor Farms to the
            modest yards of Northside, maintaining an attractive lawn has long been a point of pride for homeowners.
            However, the methods used to achieve that perfect green carpet have evolved significantly.

                <p className="text-sm">
                  Until the mid-20th century, lawn care in Richmond was largely manual—push mowers, hand watering, and
                  laborious weed removal. Many historic homes in The Fan and Church Hill still have small lawns designed
                  for this era of maintenance.

          <p>
            According to a recent survey, Richmond homeowners spend an average of 4-6 hours per week on lawn care during
            the growing season—approximately 150 hours annually. This significant time investment has many looking for

          <p>
            Traditional lawn care in Richmond typically involves a combination of regular mowing, seasonal
            fertilization, periodic weed control, and manual or timer-based irrigation.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Environmental Impact of Traditional Methods</h3>

          <p>Traditional lawn care in Richmond comes with several environmental challenges:</p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 my-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Water Usage:</strong> Many Richmond lawns receive 1-2 inches of supplemental water weekly during
              summer, with traditional irrigation systems often wasting 30-50% through evaporation and runoff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chemical Runoff:</strong> The James River watershed, which includes most Richmond neighborhoods,
              is impacted by fertilizer and pesticide runoff from residential lawns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Gas-powered lawn equipment produces significant air pollution. A typical
              gas mower produces as much hourly emissions as 11 cars.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Noise Pollution:</strong> Traditional gas mowers operate at 90-100 decibels, affecting
              neighborhood tranquility and potentially causing hearing damage with prolonged exposure.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As Richmond continues to evolve, so does the approach to lawn care. Smart lawn technology offers compelling
            advantages in terms of convenience, environmental impact, and long-term cost savings. While the initial
            investment may be higher than traditional methods, the benefits accumulate over time.

          <p className="mt-4">
            Richmond's unique combination of historic homes, varying lot sizes, and distinct neighborhood characters
            means there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, the trend toward more sustainable, efficient lawn care
            practices is clear, and smart technology is leading the way.
